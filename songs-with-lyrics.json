time not so far away\nAnd a child who lost his life looked awful lot like mine\n\n[Verse 2]\nI sat there in the dark for I don't know how long\nWithout the first idea of what to do\nI walked into the kitchen and turned the coffee maker on\nAnd stood there feeling hopeless and staring at the moon\nAnd when the house got lively, I was working double time\nScrambling eggs and trying not to cry\nJennifer was getting Isaac dressed and packed for school\nI was wondering when God left and why he didn't say goodbye\n\n[Chorus]\nI should've spent the day with my family\nInstead I tried and failed to work all day long\nLord, I should have spend the day with my family\nOn days like this, they alone make me want to carry on\n\n[Verse 3]\nThroughout the day I kept hearing all the details\nThough I didn't check in much but watch the news\nSome tragedies you know, they have no explanation\nAnd the word \"everything\" don't cover what you lose\nSo I spend the whole day pacing back and forth all by my lonesome\nQuestioning the point in trying to write a song\nAnd it sure is hard to focus on anything on all\nAnd you can't get something right when everything feels wrong\n\n[Chorus]\nI should've spent the day with the family\nInstead I tried and failed to work all day long\nI should've spend the day with family\nOn days like this they alone make me want to carry on\n\n[Verse 4]\nBy sundown I was worn out, no closer to understanding\nThe evil things that happen everyday\nMy wife and I shared a beer and talked about the future\nAgreeing on the fact that we would have to find a way\nThough sometimes I don't know how this world continues turning\nWhat has happened will never be undone\nBut tomorrow I think I'll just try to keep the day wide open\nAnd as much as they will have me, be with people that I love"},{"id":834167,"url":"https://genius.com/The-avett-brothers-it-goes-on-and-on-lyrics","title":"It Goes On and On","albumTitle":"I and Love and

stars\nLazily killing the last of a jar\nOf the strongest stuff you can drink\n\nLove takes a taxi, a young man drives\nAs soon he sees her hope fills his eyes\nBut tears follow after at the end of the ride\nBecause he might never see her again\n\nHate gets home lucky to still be alive\nHe screams over the sidewalk and into the drive\nThe clock in the kitchen says two-fifty-five\nAnd the clock in the kitchen is slow\n\nLove has been waiting patient and kind\nJust wanting a phone call or some kind of sign\nThat the one that she cares for who's out of his mind\nWill make it back safe to her arms\n\nHate stumbles forward and leans in the door\nWeary head hung down, eyes to the floor\nHe says, \"Love, I'm sorry,\" and she says, \"What for?\nI'm yours and that's it, whatever\nI should not
